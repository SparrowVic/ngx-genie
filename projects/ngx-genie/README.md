**GenieOS** (`ngx-genie`) is an advanced developer tool for the **Angular** framework, designed for visualizing, analyzing, and diagnosing the **Dependency Injection (DI)** system.

It works as an intelligent overlay on top of your application, allowing you to:

* inspect the dependency injection tree structure in real time,
* analyze the state of services,
* observe relationships between components,
* detect potential memory leaks and architectural issues.

---

## ✨ Key features

* **Tree View**
  A hierarchical view of the component tree and their Injectors (Element, Environment).

* **Org Chart**
  Visualization of the application structure as a classic organizational chart, making parent–child relationships easier to understand.

* **Matrix View**
  A powerful dependency matrix generated by a **Web Worker**.

* **Constellation View**
  An interactive force-directed graph presenting the dependency network as a constellation of nodes and connections.

* **Diagnostics**
  Automatic detection of anomalies (e.g. circular dependencies, singleton violations, heavy state).

* **Live Inspector**
  Real-time inspection of service state, including **Signals** and **Observable** values.

* **Deep Focus**
  A mode that isolates a single branch of the tree for easier analysis in large applications.

## ⚙️ Angular version compatibility

GenieOS is currently **implemented against Angular 20**.

### Current support

* ✅ **Angular 20** – fully supported and recommended

### Planned compatibility

Support for **earlier Angular versions** (e.g. Angular 17–19) is **planned**, but not yet available.


---

## 🚀 Quick start

### Installation

Using **npm**:

```bash
npm install ngx-genie --save-dev
```

Using **yarn**:

```bash
yarn add ngx-genie --dev
```

---

### Configuration

Add the provider to your application configuration (`app.config.ts`):

```ts
import {ApplicationConfig} from '@angular/core';
import {provideGenie} from 'ngx-genie';

export const appConfig: ApplicationConfig = {
  providers: [
    provideGenie({
      hotkey: 'F1',          // default: F1
      enabled: true,         // default: true
      visibleOnStart: false  // default: true
    })
  ]
};
```

## 🧩 Adding the panel component (`<ngx-genie />`)

Configuring providers alone is **not sufficient** to display the GenieOS interface.

To render the debugger panel in the application, you must add the **`<ngx-genie />`** component to the component tree, typically in the **`AppComponent`**.

### Example: `app.component.ts`

If your application uses **Standalone Components**, import the GenieOS component directly:

```ts
import {Component} from '@angular/core';
import {GenieComponent} from 'ngx-genie';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  standalone: true,
  imports: [GenieComponent],
  templateUrl: './app.component.html'
})
export class AppComponent {
}
```

### Example: `app.component.html`

Add the GenieOS component anywhere in the template (recommended at the end):

```html
<!-- other application components -->

<ngx-genie/>
```

Run the application and press **F1** (or another configured hotkey).

## 🧪 Project status

GenieOS is currently in an **experimental / early-stage** phase.

This is the **first public version** of the library and should be treated as a **proof of concept and evolving developer tool**, not a production-hardened framework.

### Important notes

* ❗ **No unit tests yet** – the library/plugin does **not currently include unit or integration tests**. Test coverage is planned for future releases.
* 🧭 APIs and internal behavior may change between versions as the project stabilizes.
* 🧠 The focus of the current version is **architecture exploration, UX experimentation, and real-world validation**.
