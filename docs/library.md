<summary id="1-core-architecture"><strong>🧱 1. Core Architecture</strong></summary>

GenieOS operates as a **runtime overlay**, which clearly distinguishes it from static analysis tools.

Instead of analyzing source code (AST), the library **inspects the live state of the application** directly in the browser’s memory. This makes it possible to visualize dynamic relationships that do not exist in a static form.

The architecture of GenieOS is **strictly layered** and deliberately separated by responsibilities.

<summary id="11-interception-layer-genieregistryservice"><strong>🛡 1.1 Interception Layer (GenieRegistryService)</strong></summary>

* **Role**

  * The “nervous system” of the library.
  * The central point for intercepting and registering DI events.

* **Mechanism**

  * Real-time monitoring of dependency resolution.
  * Mapping Angular internal references (Injectors, service instances) to stable GenieOS identifiers.
  * A bridge between Angular’s private runtime and the GenieOS data model.

</details>

<summary id="12-state-management-layer-stateservice"><strong>📊 1.2 State Management Layer (<code>*StateService</code>)</strong></summary>

* **Role**

  * The reactive “brain” of the system.
  * A lightweight alternative to classic state management libraries, designed specifically for devtools.

* **Mechanism**

  * Fully based on Angular Signals.
  * Transformation of raw registry data into semantic structures:

    * dependency trees,
    * relationship matrices,
    * service constellations.
  * Handling view logic, filtering, and search.
  * No mutation of the source of truth, ensuring data consistency across views.

</details>

<summary id="13-presentation-layer"><strong>🎨 1.3 Presentation Layer</strong></summary>

* **Role**

  * The visual layer exposed to the user.

* **Mechanism**

  * Use of `ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush` throughout the entire UI.
  * Isolation of expensive graph rendering from the host application’s change detection cycles.
  * Protection against the “Heisenberg effect”, where observing the application significantly impacts its performance.

</details>

<summary id="2-interception-mechanism"><strong>🔍 2. Interception Mechanism</strong></summary>

A key feature of GenieOS is **Runtime Dependency Injection Interception**.

While standard Angular tools focus on the **Component Tree**, GenieOS reconstructs the **Dependency Graph** — the hidden network of relationships between services, injectors, and components.

<details open>
<summary id="21-monkey-patching-injectorprototypeget"><strong>🐒 2.1 Monkey Patching <code>Injector.prototype.get</code></strong></summary>

* Intercepting every dependency resolution event is achieved by modifying the behavior of the DI mechanism at runtime.
* This allows observation of all injections without decorating or altering the user’s application code.

**Technical implications:**

* **DI Flag Decoding**

  * Flags such as `@Optional`, `@Self`, `@SkipSelf`, `@Host` are analyzed to correctly reconstruct the actual dependency resolution path.

* **Lazy loading and dynamic components**

  * The mechanism automatically covers lazy-loaded modules and dynamically created components.

* **Performance impact**

  * Minimal, synchronous overhead added to the dependency resolution process.
  * Filtering internal tokens is critical to avoid recursion and performance degradation.

<summary id="22-tree-traversal"><strong>🌳 2.2 DOM & Injector Tree Traversal</strong></summary>

Reconstructing the full DI hierarchy requires combining the logical and physical views of the application.

* Scanning starts from the application’s root components.
* Angular global debug hooks are used to map DOM elements to Angular contexts.
* The Logical View (LView) structure is analyzed, which makes it possible to:

  * detect providers that exist in configuration but are never used,
  * identify so-called “zombie services”.

<summary id="3-memory--data-structures"><strong>💾 3. Memory & Data Structures</strong></summary>

Designing a tool that analyzes large applications requires aggressive memory control.

<details open>
<summary id="31-weak-reference-strategy"><strong>🔗 3.1 Weak Reference Strategy</strong></summary>

* Internal mappings are based exclusively on weak references.
* GenieOS does not hold strong references to Angular objects.
* The Garbage Collector can freely collect destroyed components and injectors.
* This prevents memory leaks during long debugging sessions.

</details>

<details open>
<summary id="32-normalized-storage"><strong>📈 3.2 Normalized Storage</strong></summary>

* Data is stored in a normalized form (flat lists of nodes and edges).
* This enables:

  * fast linear-time filtering,
  * simple state updates,
  * easy serialization (e.g. snapshot exports).

</details>

<summary id="4-risks--limitations"><strong>⚠️ 4. Risks & Limitations</strong></summary>

GenieOS operates at a very low runtime level, which introduces certain risks.

<details open>
<summary id="41-internal-api-dependency"><strong>🔒 4.1 Internal API Dependency</strong></summary>

* The library relies on Angular private APIs, marked with the `ɵ` and `_` prefixes.
* These structures are not covered by any stability guarantees across framework versions.

**Mitigation strategy:**

* All access to private APIs is centralized in a single integration module.
* Each Angular upgrade requires verification and regression testing.

</details>

<details open>
<summary id="42-production-builds"><strong>🚧 4.2 Production Builds</strong></summary>

* In production builds, Angular global debug hooks are not available.
* Minification significantly reduces the readability of service and component names.
* The graph structure remains correct, but the diagnostic value is limited.

</details>

<details open>
<summary id="43-heuristic-analysis"><strong>❓ 4.3 Heuristic Analysis</strong></summary>

* **Heavy State Detection**

  * Approximate analysis of object complexity.
  * Limited recursion depth prevents infinite loops.

* **Coupling Score**

  * A metric based on the number of injected dependencies.
  * May generate false positives in the case of wide but rarely used services.

</details>

<summary id="5-performance-strategy"><strong>⚡ 5. Performance Strategy</strong></summary>

* Global use of `OnPush`.
* 📡 Precise, Signals-based updates.
* No full re-renders of large UI structures.
* ⏳ Deferred initialization:

  * analysis starts only after the application has stabilized,
  * heavy operations are executed during idle time.

</details>

<summary id="6-upgrade-checklist"><strong>6. Upgrade Checklist</strong></summary>

When upgrading to a new Angular version, you should:

* verify the behavior of the dependency resolution mechanism,
* check the correctness of component metadata reading,
* validate the compatibility of logical view structures,
* confirm the operation of debug hooks.
